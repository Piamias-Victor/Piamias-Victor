## Who I am ? üë®‚Äçüíª
I'm Victor Piamias, **Front-End developer** working in the **crypto environment and more especially in privacy**. I am very curious, love to learn and discover about all kinds of technologies !

I'm a graduate of the **42 school in Paris**, with my teammates we completed the course in 5 months, after that we worked as freelancers for different protocols.

Now I'm looking for a Front-End developper job in the crypto environment and if possible in relation with privacy.

## What I am building ? üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My favorite technologies are the following : **JS / TS / React / HTML / CSS**.

During my studies and my first experiences I was able to acquire a **very good mastery** of these tools allowing me to be a complete Front-End developer. Moreover I actively worked with a more experienced developer ([hazae41](https://github.com/hazae41)) who is a kind of mentor for me, allowing me to **learn and improve my skills.**

I also had the opportunity to explore many technologies that I have not fully mastered yet but on which I can perform basic tasks or train to be independent on it : **Rust / Web Assembly / Solidity / The Graph**

## My Project üèóÔ∏è

With my teamates from 42 we won two prizes at ETHBrno in a privacy oriented hackaton (The overall hackaton prize & the design prize) with a privacy oriented wallet using TOR.

 -    [Brume Wallet](https://github.com/Piamias-Victor/brume-wallet)  / First privacy native Ethereum wallet based on a built-in integration of TOR
 -   [Brume Logs](https://github.com/Piamias-Victor/brume-wallet)  / A website to present the project, the problem solved and its solution
 -    [Brume UI](https://github.com/Piamias-Victor/Brume-UI)  / A more global and complete version of the wallet interface


I also realized many projects during my studies in 42 school. They allowed me to have a solid mastery of C and C++, algorithms, clean code and lots of good practices to be a more efficient developer, here are the most relevant
